  This paper addresses the lack of social media mining related to the mpox outbreak by providing a labeled multilingual dataset of 60,127 Instagram posts. The dataset includes analyses for sentiment, hate speech, and anxiety detection, categorized into various classes, providing a resource for studying public sentiment and discourse surrounding health crises on social media.

  The paper focuses on medical imaging and histological assessment rather than on any topics related to reinforcement learning or the user's research interests.

- Summary
  
  This research presents a method for virtually staining lung and heart transplant biopsies using neural networks to convert label-free autofluorescence images into brightfield histological images, eliminating the need for traditional staining processes. The study demonstrates that virtual staining can produce high-quality images that yield comparable diagnostic outcomes to traditional methods, achieving a concordance rate of 82.4% for lung and 91.7% for heart samples. This innovation potentially saves time, costs, and tissue samples in transplant evaluations.

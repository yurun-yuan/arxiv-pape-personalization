  The paper presents a model-agnostic approach for detecting new particles in high-energy physics by dynamically defining Signal Regions enriched with signal events even when prior domain knowledge is lacking. It utilizes localized topology and density ratio learning to identify areas in high-dimensional feature space that are significantly affected by underlying signal events, demonstrating its efficacy through simulations of specific particle interactions.

  The work is centered around federated learning and privacy preservation, which does not correlate with the reinforcement learning theory and value-based offline RL interests.  

- Summary
  
  This paper presents FedMD-CG, an innovative federated learning method that prioritizes both privacy preservation and high performance. By decoupling local models into feature extractors and classifiers, and employing a conditional generator for server-side aggregation, the method effectively uses knowledge distillation to maintain the consistency of model outputs while being robust to data heterogeneity.

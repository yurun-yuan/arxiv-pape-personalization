  Similar to researcher 1, this work does not resonate with researcher 2's interests in reinforcement learning theory and value-based offline approaches, as it is centered on graph autoencoders and community structures instead.
- Summary

  The paper introduces PieClam, a probabilistic graph model for representing graphs as overlapping communities, expanding the capabilities of previous models like BigClam. It incorporates a learned prior for node distribution in a code space and generalizes community detection to include both inclusive and exclusive communities, providing competitive performance in graph anomaly detection tasks.

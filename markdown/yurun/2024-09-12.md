- Authors: T. Aleksandra Ma, Alexander Lerch
- Keywords: Few-shot Learning, Music Auto-tagging, Transfer Learning, Linear Probe, Multi-label Classification
- Relevance: 1

  The research is focused on few-shot learning and automatic tagging in music, which is not aligned with RLHF or RLAIF, making it largely irrelevant to their interests.  
- Summary

  This paper presents a few-shot learning approach for music auto-tagging that allows models to accurately apply tags to music with limited labeled data. By integrating features from pre-trained models into a lightweight linear classifier, the proposed method achieves near-state-of-the-art performance while relying on significantly fewer training samples. The findings suggest that this approach can effectively tackle the challenge of long-tail tagging in music databases.
